In this problem, we would like to find essentially what is the shortest path between the top left cell and the bottom right cell of the grid, where the metric of distance is given by the number of Larry's passed over along the way.  However, we can make an observation that simplifies the problem: because Devon can only travel to the right or down, in order to reach any specific cell, Devon must come from either the cell directly above or the cell directly to the left.  The fact that Devon cannot move "backwards" allows us to not have to use a shortest path algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm, and instead use a more efficient approach.

As this problem is easily decomposable into smaller, similar problems, we are motivated to use a dynamic programming approach.  Because any path through a cell must go through either the cell above or to the left, we can keep track of the shortest path to each individual cell by building it up from previous cells.  We know that the shortest path to the starting cell is $0$.  We then find that the shortest path to any given cell $ C_{i,j}$ is the minimum of the shortest paths to $C_{i-1,j}$ and $C_{i,j-1}$ (if these cells exist) plus the number of Larrys on cell $C_{i,j}$.  We can then use this to build up a grid of shortest paths, using previous results to calculate the shortest path to the next cell.  After calculating this grid, the answer will be found at $C_{N,N}$ (for a 1-indexed grid).
