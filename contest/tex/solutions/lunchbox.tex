In this question, we are given a series of instructions, as well as a starting location, and must determine the ending location.  Following each instruction takes $ O(n) $ time, and because the number of queries is less than $ 1,000,000 $, we can simply follow each instruction and trace out Alex's path, in order to determine the location of the lunchbox.  This can be accomplished with a variable storing Alex's location, and a loop: at every iteration of the loop, we adjust the location of Alex depending on the instruction, and repeat through all the instructions.
