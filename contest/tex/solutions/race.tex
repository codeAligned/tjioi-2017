In this problem, we know that in order for the robot to outrun Larry, the robot's average speed must be faster than Larry's average speed. Speed is given by

$$ S = \frac{D}{T} $$

where $ S $ is the speed, $ D $ is the distance travelled, and $ T $ is the time taken to travel the distance.  We are provided with the distance and time for both the robot as well as each of Larry's attempts, so we can calculate the speed for the robot and compare it to the speed for each of Larry's attempts.
