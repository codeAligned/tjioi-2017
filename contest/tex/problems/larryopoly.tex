\section{Larryopoly}

Tired of digging out change at the TJ IOI Inc.\@ vending machines, Larry, being rich, decides to invent his own currency to be used by all TJ IOI employees. He creates $ N $ ($ 1 \leq N \leq 100 $) different types of bills, each with a unique dollar value $ d_i $ ($ 1 \leq d_i \leq 1,000 $).

Although many employees are initially skeptical, Niki decides to use this currency. Niki wants to feel rich, so he wants to maximize the number of bills he can hold. However, Niki refuses to take more than one bill of each kind. Niki will ask $ M $ times ($ 1 \leq M \leq 100,000 $) if he can hold $ X $ amount of value in Larryâ€™s currency ($ 1 \leq X \leq 1,000,000 $) and if so, how many bills that will take.
