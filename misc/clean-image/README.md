# clean-image

A short C++ program stolen from code for Computer Vision. The goal was simply to apply a threshold to a picture of a signature, so that every pixel would be either black or white, removing the slight coloration of the background. Of course, you can probably figure out how to do this with an image editing program such as [LunaPic](http://www.lunapic.com/).
