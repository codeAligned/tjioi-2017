\section{Work}

At TJ IOI Inc., we pride ourselves in the vast amount of work that gets done.  Every day, over three million hand-written instances of the word ``work" are manufactured for consumption.  However, TJ IOI Inc. has contracted you to build a better machine to manufacture specific amounts of the word ``work".  Please help increase our productivity!
