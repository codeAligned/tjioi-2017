\section{Pencils}

In order to prepare for his math test tomorrow, Alex has gathered $ N $ ($ 1 \leq N \leq 10^5 $) pencils in front of him. However, his pencil bag only has room for $ K $ pencils ($ 1 \leq K \leq N $). Each of his pencils has an integer length in the range of $ 1 $ to $ 1000 $, inclusive. Because Alex's math test is really hard, he needs to write a lot if he wants to get a good grade, and so Alex wants to choose the longest $ K $ pencils to place into his pencil bag.  Please help Alex pass his math test!
