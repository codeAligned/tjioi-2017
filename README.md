# TJ IOI 2017

This is the GitHub repository for the official contest materials for TJ IOI 2017.  TJ IOI 2017 was held on Saturday, May 13, 2017 at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.  Contest information can be found [here](https://activities.tjhsst.edu/tjioi/).

## Written Round

The written round is a one hour theoretical round in which competitors answered questions regarding a specific computer science topic, using pseudocode and writing proofs and explanations.  The round is worth a total of 200 points, scaled up to 600 points for total point calculations.  The `tex` files for the written round can be found in the folder `written`, and the contest PDF can be found in the main folder.

## Programming Round

The programming round is a three hour contest consisting of ten problems.  Competitors code solutions to each problem, and then submit their code to be judged against ten test cases which they cannot see.  Each test case is worth 10 points, with 10 test cases per problem for 1000 total points across the round.  The programming round files can be found in the `contest` folder.  The `tex` files are stored in the `tex` folder, and each problem is stored by short name in its own folder.  Within each folder, the folders `input` and `output` store the individual test cases and correct outputs, respectively.  The solution code can be found in the folder `sol`.  Contest and problem `yaml` files are also found within the respective folders.

## Practice Programming Round

The practice programming round files can be found in the `practice` folder.  Files are organized the same way as the programming round.  No analyses are provided for the practice programming round; however, solution code can be found in the corresponding folders.
